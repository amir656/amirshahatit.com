<p> Since this was a school project, I can't post my code anywhere, but I would gladly talk with you about the implementation of any aspects of any of these projects:)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a>Enigma (Java)</a></h3>
      <p> Developed an encoder with the same functionality as the notorious enigma machine from World War II. Flexible enough to use almost any size and format of alphabet.</p>
      <p> Here's a link to the Project Spec: <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa16/materials/proj/proj1/index.html"> Enigma</a></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Ataxx (Java)</h3>
      <p>Created a board game and an AI to play it intelligently enough to find a forced win in 5 moves.</p>
       <p> Here's a link to the Project Spec: <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa16/materials/proj/proj2/index.html"> Ataxx</a></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Music Classifier (Python/Jupyter)</h3>
      <p>Created a classifier that determined whether a song is country or hip-hop.</p>
       <p>I have this in a private Github repo. If you send me your username, I can add you as a collaborator:)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Electricity exploration (Python/Jupyter)</h3>
      <p>Investigated the relationship between electricity prices and where you live, as well as prices over time as compared to inflation.</p>
